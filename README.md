# pandas-challenge

- In this challenge we have to analyze information from schools in a city. To begin, we divide our analysis into two different scenarios. In the first one we analyze data at the district level to obtain general information in different areas: total schools, students, and average scores obtained in reading and mathematics. In the second scenario we do a more in-depth analysis, obtaining data from each of the schools to know in more detail what is happening in each of them and have more clarity to be able to make decisions or develop a strategy.

- You will see the groupby function has been used repeatedly to be able to make all the filters (groupings) according to what we wanted to visualize. It is very useful and very effective in obtaining results even with many conditions.

- This code was implemented by Ivan Corona.
